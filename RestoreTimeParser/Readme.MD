# Description

This tool is for helping to identify which projects are taking the longest to restore in a large solution.

It parses the restore.log file that is generated by MSBuild when running a restore, and outputs a CSV file with the project path and the restore time in milliseconds, seconds, and minutes.

The CSV file can then be opened in the analysis tool of your choice and sorted by the restore time columns to identify the slowest projects.

Usage: RestoreTimeParser.exe \path\to\restore.log \path\to\outputfile.csv
