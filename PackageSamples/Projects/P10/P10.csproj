  <!--
    This project is a child of project P9.  The goal is to see if PrivateAssets modification
	in a parent project has an impact on the child.  The answer is no.
	
	However, it's also worth looking at P9.  P9 includes P8, which includes this project (P10).
	Because P8 includes J and sets PrivateAssets="all", it does not flow up to P9's project.assets.json.
