	    P9 (this project) includes P8.  However, P8 sets PrivateAssets="all" for Package J,
		which means that this project (P9) cannot see the assets of Package J.  This is true
		even though project P8 references package K which has a reference to package J.
		This PrivateAssets behavior applies because it occurs at a higher level in the graph
		and is declared on a direct reference on P8.
		
		Effectively, P8 is saying "I don't want to export the assets of package J to anyone
		that happens to include me."
