	    There are conflicting version overrides that come from each of these projects.
		P01 overrides the version of package M and P02 overrides the version of package L.
		In each of the project.assets.json files for those projects, they show the proper
		version overrides.  However, here, neither gets overridden, because the override is specific
		to the children.  Thus here, we get L/2.0, M/2.0, and N/1.0 which is exactly what Packages.props (central versions) specifies.
