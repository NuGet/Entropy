	    Package I includes content files, which are treated differently than other build assets.
		The two files are A.txt and B.txt.  They show up in the project.assets.json like this:
		
		    "contentFiles": {
              "contentFiles/any/any/A.txt": {
                "buildAction": "Content",
                "codeLanguage": "any",
                "copyToOutput": true,
                "outputPath": "A.txt"
              },
              "contentFiles/any/any/B.txt": {
                "buildAction": "Content",
                "codeLanguage": "any",
                "copyToOutput": true,
                "outputPath": "B.txt"
              }
            }

		The fields for each of these can be set in the nuspec, and of course the files are impacted
		by IncludeAssets/ExcludeAssets/PrivateAssets in the same ways as other assets in the packages.
