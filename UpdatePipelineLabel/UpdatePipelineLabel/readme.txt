Update pipeline label for all issues in the specified repository:
Command: UpdatePipelineLabel.exe NuGet/Home <githubToken> <zenhubToken>

Update pipeline label for a range of issues in the specified repository: 
(rarely used, only used if huge number of issues need to process, and rate limiting changed for Github, for now, 5000/hr and Patch 1/s)
Command: UpdatePipelineLabel.exe NuGet/Home <githubToken> <zenhubToken> --from 0 --to 9000

Note: 
1.It's safe to run the command repeatedly.
  It will only update the issues that need updating from the current state. 
  Issues with the right pipeline label and no wrong pipeline label will be skipped.

2.You have to wait about 30 seconds until you start to see the outputs.(wait for getting all the 60+ pages issues from github!)
